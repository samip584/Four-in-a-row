Four in a row
Itâ€™s a simple strategical multiplayer and single player game, your goal is to defeat your enemy by making 4 of your character occur consecutively horizontal vertical or diagonal.
You can play against an opponent in multiplayer mode or just a simple AI in the single player mode.

You lose when your opponent makes four in a row.
